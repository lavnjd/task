Git is a version control system 
    - Centralized version control
    - Distributed version control
The main usage of version controls is to work on software configuration management which merges modules.
Centralized version control: 
         -Earlier one
         -Remote repository
         -network needed
         -if server is down the files can't be retrieved
Distributed version control:
         -New one
         -Local repository
         -copy of files will be created in local repositories when network connection is there they will be sent or stored in server
Trunk Base development:
         -Different versions
         -upto that project is under 4.5v version but now we have to work on 5v, 4.5 will have a branch that is master branch to run the same program in 5V it should 
         create a new branch which works for 5v and merge the both branches.
